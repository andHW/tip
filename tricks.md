# Tricks

I'm trying to document some efficent way to drill the coding problems.

## Using Python Template

1. cd to certain directory
2. run the following command

```bash
cp ../tp.py ./<oj-name>-<question-tag>.py
```

## Running Input

1. create a file with sample/custom input in the root directory
2. cd to the directory containing the code (1-level down)
3. run the following command

```bash
py ./codechef-helium3.py < ../<in-file>
```

(adjust command and file structure/name accordingly)
